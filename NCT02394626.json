    {
      "theme": "study_purpose",
      "prompt": "What is the primary aim of the RESURGE clinical trial (NCT02394626)?",
      "completion": "To compare the effect of craniotomy and tumor resection followed by second-line therapy versus no surgery followed by second-line therapy on overall survival, neurological status, and quality of life in patients with recurrent glioblastoma."
    },
    {
      "theme": "study_rationale",
      "prompt": "Why is a randomized controlled trial necessary in the RESURGE study for glioblastoma recurrence?",
      "completion": "Although retrospective analyses suggest a survival benefit from surgery for recurrent glioblastoma, an EORTC meta-analysis found no difference. A randomized trial is needed to provide reliable evidence for or against surgical intervention at recurrence."

      "theme": "treatment_arms",
      "prompt": "What are the treatment arms in the RESURGE trial (NCT02394626)?",

    {
      "theme": "background",
      "prompt": "What challenges are associated with treating recurrent glioblastoma?",
      "completion": "Glioblastoma is highly invasive and recurs almost invariably after initial treatment. Despite advances in surgery and radio-chemotherapy, recurrence poses significant therapeutic challenges with limited effective options."
    },
    {
      "theme": "rationale",
      "prompt": "Why is a second surgery being considered in recurrent glioblastoma cases?",
      "completion": "Second surgery may reduce tumor burden and potentially enhance the effectiveness of second-line treatments, possibly improving survival. However, it also carries risks of neurological deficits and surgical complications, necessitating evidence from randomized trials."
